## ðŸ§  About the Project

**ZOE (Zephyr OPC UA ESP32)** is an open-source initiative that demonstrates how to run an **OPC UA server** on **ESP32** using the [**open62541**](https://github.com/open62541/open62541) stack and **Zephyr RTOS**.

The project provides a working reference for implementing **industrial-grade communication protocols** in embedded devices. It is ideal for developers working with IoT, IIoT, automation systems, and standardized data exchange over OPC UA.
